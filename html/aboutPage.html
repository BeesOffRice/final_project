            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously
                 became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history.
                  In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings,
                   most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, 
                   still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic
                   , impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not 
                   commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading 
                   to his suicide at age thirty-seven.</p>
